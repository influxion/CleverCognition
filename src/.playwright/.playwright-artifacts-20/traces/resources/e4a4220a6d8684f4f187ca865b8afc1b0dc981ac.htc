This custom ecommerce experience demonstrates my skills in using the Shopify Storefront API, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, all while being hosted on Vercel and tested with Playwright.</p>\n<p>Clever Cognition: The Perfect Showcase</p>\n<p>As a puzzle enthusiast, I found that creating an ecommerce platform featuring a diverse range of puzzles and games was the perfect project to showcase my adaptability and proficiency in working with different technologies. This project highlights my ability to pick up and go with any tech, regardless of its complexity or novelty.</p>\n<p>The Technology Stack</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tailwind CSS</li>\n<li>TypeScript</li>\n<li>Next.js</li>\n<li>Shopify Storefront API</li>\n<li>Playwright</li>\n<li>Vercel</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Challenges</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Next.js App Router: One of the main challenges I faced during the development of Clever Cognition was working with the Next.js App Router. As a relatively new feature, the available documentation was limited, making it difficult to find the information needed to efficiently implement it. To overcome this challenge, I had to dig deep into GitHub issues and source code, piecing together the knowledge I needed to effectively use the App Router.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In some instances, I reached out to the Next.js and Vercel team, discussing the intricacies and caveats of the technology, as well as gathering their insights and recommendations. One notable contribution I made was helping the Next.js team with GitHub issue #49353, where there was a server method issue causing the body of the request to corrupt on DELETE requests. Through investigation and collaboration, we found that the issue was caused by a small oversight when receiving the request and setting it. My involvement in resolving this issue demonstrates my perseverance, problem-solving abilities, and ability to adapt.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Shopify Storefront API: Another challenge that I encountered was integrating the Shopify Storefront API with TypeScript. The API is primarily designed for vanilla JavaScript, which posed some compatibility issues and required additional effort to create a seamless experience. To tackle this, I researched various solutions and workarounds, experimenting with different approaches to find the most efficient way to integrate the API into the TypeScript-based project. This process involved reading through the API documentation, analyzing the source code, and even seeking advice from the Shopify developer community. As a result, I was able to create a smooth and seamless integration of the Shopify Storefront API with TypeScript, further showcasing my resourcefulness and persistence in overcoming technical challenges.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These challenges provided me with an opportunity to demonstrate my adaptability and problem-solving skills, as well as my eagerness to learn and work with new technologies. Tackling these obstacles head-on allowed me to grow as a developer and create an innovative and user-focused application in Clever Cognition</p>"}}]]
